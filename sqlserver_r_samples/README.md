<h2 align="center">SQL Server with R Services - Samples</h2>
</head>

The samples included in this section show how to use SQL Server with the embedded R Services engine. 

Noteably, these samples will provide templates for how to:

* Execute R scripts using SQL Server Management Studio
* Train and Deploy an analytic model
* Score data using an existing model, both in batch and interactive modes
* Generate visualizations to be used in reports and publications

Many of the samples use Microsoft's sample database [Wide World Importers OLTP/DW](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/). Samples that use other datasets will list pre-requisites in the comments. 

Additionally, these samples require [SQL Server 2016](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2016) with the [R Services In-Database engine](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt696069.aspx) enabled. Access to an Azure subscription to deploy a [Data Science Virtual Machine](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/microsoft-ads.standard-data-science-vm) is the recommended approach to getting started with Microsoft R Server and SQL Server.

These content samples are used in [BlueGranite's Advanced Analytics Workhop](http://www.blue-granite.com/advanced-analytics-workshop)
