<h2 align="center">Microsoft R Server - Samples</h2>
</head>

The samples included in this section showcase various features of Microsoft R Server. Especially those that distinquish it from open-source R and Microsoft R Open.

Noteably, these samples will provide templates for how to:

* Use XDF format to distribute code for parallel processing
* Use multiple compute contexts to scale analytic solutions beyond developer workstations
* Take advantage of additional analytic functionality offered in the ScaleR package
* Use common analytic functions and models to build intelligent solutions

Many of the samples use Microsoft's sample database [Wide World Importers OLTP/DW](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/). Samples that use other datasets will list pre-requisites in the comments. 

Additionally, these samples require [Microsoft R Client](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-r/r-client-get-started) or [Microsoft R Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/r-server) to have access to the [ScaleR](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-r/scaler/scaler) functions for parallelization.  [R Studio](http://www.rstudio.com) or [R Tools for Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/rtvs/) is recommended to use the samples. Access to an Azure subscription to deploy a [Data Science Virtual Machine](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/microsoft-ads.standard-data-science-vm) is the recommended approach to getting started with Microsoft R Server.

These content samples are used in [BlueGranite's Advanced Analytics Workhop](http://www.blue-granite.com/advanced-analytics-workshop)
